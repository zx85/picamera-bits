# picamera-bits

A place to store my shell scripts that grab pictures from the raspberry pi camera, and, every half hour, rotate them, put a note on them and stick them somewhere else. Using libcamera-jpeg on a crontab becuase the timelapse function chews up CPU for no reason.

Requires:
- pi camera
- imagemagick
- ffmpeg
